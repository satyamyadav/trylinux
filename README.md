<div ><h3><b>Linux</b></h3>
<small>a short description </small>
<p>Linux is a Unix-like computer operating system assembled under the model of
free and open source software development and distribution. The defining
component of Linux is the Linux kernel,an operating system kernel first
released on 5 October 1991 by Linus Torvalds.
Linux was originally developed as a free operating system for Intel x86-based
personal computers. It has since been ported to more computer hardware
platforms than any other operating system. It is a leading operating system on
servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers and
supercomputers. As of June 2013, more than 95% of the world's 500 fastest
supercomputers run some variant of Linux, including all the 44 fastest. Linux
also runs on embedded systems, which are devices whose operating system is
typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system; this
includes mobile phones,tablet computers, network routers, facility automation
controls, televisions and video game consoles. Android, which is a widely used
operating system for mobile devices, is built on top of the Linux kernel.</p>
